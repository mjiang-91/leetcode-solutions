## How to contribute 

**One question one file**, name convention is `[question no]-[short url].py`.

Take question 1 for example, URL is (https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)[https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/], so name is `1-two-sum.py`.

Remember to write test cases in each file, name convention is `test_xxx`, you can specify whatever name with `xxx`.

## How to run tests

Change directory to the root directory of this repo where you can find `pytest.ini` in the same level and run following command:

```bash
pytest
```

You should find following output:

    $ pytest
    ==================================== test session starts ====================================
    platform win32 -- Python 3.5.2, pytest-4.0.1, py-1.7.0, pluggy-0.8.0
